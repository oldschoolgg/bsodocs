## Extra Information

The most coveted drop from King Goldemar is the Broken Dwarven Warhammer, which when repaired becomes the Dwarven Warhammer (DWWH). When equipped in any gear setup, it provides a 40% speed boost to all =k PVM activities. This does not include Nex, Vasa Magus, Ignecarus.

Players can equip a Ring of Luck, obtained via Grandmaster Clue Scrolls, in the melee setup to increase the drop rate of receiving the Broken Dwarven warhammer drop. **Note: If Participating in a mass, only 1 member of the party needs to have a Ring of Luck equipped to receive the increased drop rate.**

It is recommended to Mass for the 1st 50kc as it reduces your death chance.

# General Information

All xp in BSO is granted a 5x boost from OSB/OSRS rates.

### Global Boosts

There are five extremely rare items called [First Age](../custom-items/equippables.md#first-age) that each boost all xp gains by 1% with an additional 1% added if you have all 5 equipped.

Having any [master cape](../custom-items/equippables.md#master-capes) equipped anywhere will give a global 3% boost to all xp gained. This goes up to 8% when training the skill you have mastery in.

All rates described in [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") are shown without these global boosts. Boosts from osb all work in bso and will not be discussed on this wiki.

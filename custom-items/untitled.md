#### Dwarven Armor

Dwarven armor is smithable from Dwarven Bars with 120 Smithing and is also dropped by King Goldemar \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\). It currently provides no boosts to content but provides high crush defence.

| Dwarven Platebody | 5 |
| Dwarven Platelegs | 4 |
| Dwarven Boots | 2 |

#### Other Dwarven Gear

These dwarven gear are unlike the previous in that they are not smithable from Dwarven bars and instead are rare drops.

**Dwarven Warhammer**: Rare drop from King Goldemar \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\) and provides a 40% PvM boost. Drops as a **Broken Dwarven Warhammer** and must be fixed, requiring 120 Smithing, Blacksmith's Outfit, and Dwarven Bars.

**Dwarven Blessing**: Rare drop from Grandmaster Caskets \(see [Misc](misc.md)\) and provides a 20% boost to PvM \(25% with Amulet of Zealots\). Consumes 1 Prayer Potion per 5 minutes of PvM \(reduced by 40% with Prayer Master Cape\).

### Abyssal Equipment

Abyssal equipment can be obtained by killing Malygos \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\). 

* Abyssal Cape - Provides an aura which reduces food consumption by 50%
* Dragon Hunter Lance - Provides a large boost against dragons \(varies\)

### Nex Equipment

The following items can be obtained by killing Nex \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\). These items all have very high bonuses in their respective style, Pernix - range, Torva - melee, and Virtus - magic. 

* **Pernix**: Cowl, Body, Legs, Gloves, Boots
* **Torva**: Full Helm, Platebody, Platelegs, Gloves, Boots
* **Virtus**: Hood, Rob Top, Robe Legs, Gloves, Boots, Wand Book

These items can also be upgraded \(except for Virtus Wand and Book\) using Gorajan Shards to make Gorajan Armor.

Additionally, the **Zartye** **Bow** is also obtainable as a drop. It provides the highest range attack and strength bonus of any bow and gives a 20% boost to Nex.

### Drygore Weapons

Drygore weapons are a drop from the Kalphite King \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\). Each type of weapon has a main hand a offhand pair. 

* **Drygore Rapier** + **Offhand Drygore Rapier** - BiS CoX Points and CoX boost
* **Drygore Mace** + **Offhand Drygore Rapier** - BiS Kalphite King
* **Drygore Longsword** + **Offhand Drygore Longsword** - BiS King Goldemar

### Dungeoneering Gear

There are various types of gear that can be obtained from Dungeoneering \(see [Dungeoneering](../minigames/untitled.md)\). 

The following gear can be bought with tokens:

| Item | Token Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Chaotic Rapier | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Longsword | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Maul | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Staff | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Crossbow | 200,000 |
| Offhand Chaotic Rapier | 100,000 |
| Offhand Chaotic Longsword | 100,000 |
| Offhand Chaotic Crossbow | 100,000 |
| Farseer Kiteshield | 200,000 |
| Amulet of Zealots | 400,000 |

None of the above have any perks or bonuses besides their respective stats except for the **Amulet of Zealots** which provides an extra 5% boost to the **Dwarven Blessing** or 10% if killing a mob in the Wilderness.

Additionally, with a **Chaotic Remnant** \(500,000 tokens\), the three BiS amulets can be created:

* Amulet of Torture + Chaotic Remnant =  **Brawler's Fury Necklace**
* Necklace of Anguish + Chaotic Remnant = **Farsight Snapshot Necklace**
* Occult Necklace + Chaotic Remnant = **Arcane Blast Necklace**

**Gorajan Armor** is made by using Gorajan Shards with Nex Armor. Each piece of armor requires 2 Gorajan Shards to upgrade and will become untradeable. Stats will remain the same as the original Nex Armor but give additional boosts. They give 2x XP when used to train their respective style \(ex. Gorajan Occult Outfit gives 2x Magic XP\) and they also give a boost to Dungeoneering XP.

* Torva + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Warrior Outfit**
  * Gives boost at King Goldemar
* Virtus + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Occult Outfit**
* Pernix + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Archer Outfit**

### Clue Hunter Outfit

The Clue Hunter outfit can be obtained as a rare drop from Grandmaster Caskets \(see [Misc](misc.md)\). Previously it was obtainable from the Crack the Clue event. It gives a 2x speed boost to completing clues and increases Grandmaster Clue drop rate from Master caskets. 

* Helm of Raedwald
* Clue Hunter Cloak
* Clue Hunter Garb
* Clue Hunter Trousers
* Clue Hunter Boots
* Clue Hunter Gloves

### Master Farmer Outfit

The Master Farmer outfit is craftable with 110 Crafting using Ent hides dropped from Treebeard \(see [Bosses](bosses/)\). The outfit gives +3 extra maximum patches, for every type of patch. This stacks with the +2 patches from the Scroll of farming. It does not have to be equipped.

| Piece | Ent Hide Needed |
| :--- | :--- |
| Master Farmer Hat | 1 |
| Master Farmer Jacket | 3 |
| Master Farmer Pants | 2 |
| Master Farmer Boots | 1 |
| Master Farmer Gloves | 1 |

### Master Capes

Master capes are skillcapes that can be purchased upon getting 500M XP in the respective skill. The command to purchase a master cape is `=skillcape hunter master cape` for example. Each one costs 1b gp to purchase and is untradeable. A master cape will provide 8% XP boost if training the corresponding skill, or 3% when training any other skill. This perk is global, and the master cape can be equipped in any gear tab to receive the XP boost. Master capes also have the same stats as an Abyssal Cape without the food reduction perk. 

Additionally, master capes have a perk that is related to the skill that they are corresponding to. Skills with missing perks are either yet to be added or still unknown.

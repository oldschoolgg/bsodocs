# Pets

There are pets exclusive to BSO that provide unique and powerful perks and are rare drops from certain activities. These custom pets must equipped using `/gear pet equip:`**`name`**\` and in most cases, only one pet's effect can be active at once. All pets with a per minute drop rate can only be obtained on trips that are at least 20 minute long.

\*Zippy increases in rarity through eastern ferrets based on how many you have in your CL. the base drop is 1/3500 with no zippys in your CL, it _roughly_ doubles for each zippy you have. This is in order to protect the value of zippy, whilst not making it impossible to get more than 1, while making it viable to get your _first_ zippy from here.

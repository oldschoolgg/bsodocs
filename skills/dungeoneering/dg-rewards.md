## Buyable Gear

The following gear can be bought with tokens:

| Item | Token Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Chaotic Rapier | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Longsword | 200,000 |
| Chaotic Maul | 200,000 |

None of the above have any perks or bonuses besides their respective stats except for the **Amulet of Zealots** which provides an extra 5% boost to the **Dwarven Blessing** or 10% if killing a mob in the Wilderness.

Additionally, with a **Chaotic Remnant** \(500,000 tokens\), the three BiS amulets can be created:

* Amulet of Torture + Chaotic Remnant =  **Brawler's Hook Necklace**
* Necklace of Anguish + Chaotic Remnant = **Farsight Snapshot Necklace**
* Occult Necklace + Chaotic Remnant = **Arcane Blast Necklace**

**Gorajan Armor** is made by using Gorajan Shards with Nex Armor. Each piece of armor requires 2 Gorajan Shards to upgrade and will become untradeable. Stats will remain the same as the original Nex Armor but give additional boosts. They give 2x XP when used to train their respective style \(ex. Gorajan Occult Outfit gives 2x Magic XP\) and they also give a boost to Dungeoneering XP.

* Torva + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Warrior Outfit**
  * Gives boost at King Goldemar
* Virtus + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Occult Outfit**
* Pernix + Gorajan Shards = **Gorajan Archer Outfit**

# Dungeoneering

## Starting Out

There are 1-7 floors.
Each floor requires +20 DG levels, and increasingly higher stats in other skills, especially combat.

F7 Requirements


`=dg start [floor]` to actually do dungeoneering. The floor is optional to provide.
You can only do a floor for which you have the required stats, it will automatically pick the highest floor you can do.

`=dg buy [name]` to buy a reward.

`=dg` to see your tokens and max floor.

While doing dungeoneering in dungeons of Floor 5+, you have a chance of getting a
tradeable Gorajan shard. You can combine 2 of these with a nex armor piece to make a 
gorajan armor piece, using smithing. \(see [Dungeoneering Rewards](./dg-rewards.md)\). 

## Boosts
You get boosts to your dungeoneering speed from: dung cape OR master dung cape, scroll of teleportation, and gorajan armor. 
You get negative boosts (slower) from doing solo or duo dungeons.
You receive less XP if doing a floor lower than your max floor.

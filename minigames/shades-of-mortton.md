# Shades of Mort'ton

The first is a necromancer kit at a rate of 1/375. You need 3 of these to /create the necromancer outfit. The kits are consumed in the process and can not be returned

The second is a shade skull at a rate of 1/400. You use the shade skull to /create several necromancer and skeletal staff variants. You can revert these staffs to receive the shade skull and staff back meaning you only need 1 skull to create all the staffs for the overall+ cl slots.&#x20;

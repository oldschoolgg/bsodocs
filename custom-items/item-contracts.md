# Item Contracts

Item contracts work similar to Farming contracts, the bot will ask you for a random item, and you hand it in for a reward. You get GP, clue scrolls, XP Lamps, dragon and rune items as rewards.

You can get a item contract using `=itemcontract`, or `=ic` for short. This is also how you check your current contract, and hand in your item.

* You can be assigned any item that's dropped by TMB's or UMB's
* You build up a streak if you don't skip any contracts, reaching certain divisible milestones in your streak grants you an extra reward. Every 10th, 25th, 50th, 100th contract gets you a bonus reward, proportional to the size of the streak. It pays to not skip!
* Item contracts can be skipped, however this will reset your streak and incur a 4 hour cooldown.
* You can buy the assigned item off other players, you don't have to obtain it yourself.

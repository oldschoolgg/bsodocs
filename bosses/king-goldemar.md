# King Goldemar

King Goldemar is a boss that can be done in a mass or solo. Please go to the channel #mass-king-goldemar for more info.

The entrance fee to fight King Goldemar is 10 million but it can be reduced to 5m if a Ring of Charos is equipped.

## Extra Information

The most coveted drop from King Goldemar is the Broken dwarven warhammer, which when repaired via smithing, becomes the Dwarven warhammer (DWWH). When equipped in any gear setup, it provides a 40% speed boost to all /k activities excluding those in the wilderness. (See the Hellfire Bow for the wilderness equivalent) This does not include any bosses, but does work on some Demi Bosses.

Players can equip a Ring of Luck (obtained via [Grandmaster Clue Scrolls](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/grandmaster-clues)) in the melee setup to increase the drop rate of receiving the Broken Dwarven Warhammer drop. **Note: If participating in a mass, only 1 member of the party needs to have a Ring of Luck equipped to receive the increased drop rate.**

It is recommended to Mass for the 1st[^1] 50kc as it reduces your death chance.

# Leagues

Leagues is the name for the feature where you can complete tasks in BSO for points, which can be spent on rewards. Leagues is \*not\* the same as leagues in OSRS, nor is it meant to be.

* Leagues is done on the BSO bot
* Leagues is permanent
* Leagues is optional and not required for anything
* Leagues is just a fun extra thing you can do if you want to



## Commands

* `/leagues check` : see your current overall leagues progress
* `/leagues claim` : claim all available/points tasks.&#x20;
* `/leagues view_task`: view a specific task and how many have completed it
* `/leagues view_all_tasks` : view all leagues tasks
* `/leagues view_all_tasks exclude_finished:True` : view all tasks, excluding ones you have finished.
* `/lb leagues` : see the leagues leaderboards

## How it works

1. You complete tasks in BSO.
2. You use `/leagues claim` to claim points
3. You spend those points for rewards.

### Notes

* You have 2 separate point balances, one for OSB and one for BSO. So, if you claimed a task and got 100 points, you can spend 100 points in OSB and spend 100 points in BSO too, as they are separate.
* &#x20;You _have_ to claim (using /leagues claim) in order to mark the tasks as finished and get points.



## Rewards

### Rewards in OSB

All Leagues rewards that you can get in OSRS, are available to buy with points in OSB.

You can see all of them here: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leagues\_Reward\_Shop](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leagues\_Reward\_Shop)

You buy them using `/buy`. For any ornament kit items or similar, such as trailblazer graceful, you can use `/create` to make the resulting items.

### Rewards in BSO

There are currently no rewards in BSO, but we do plan to add some.

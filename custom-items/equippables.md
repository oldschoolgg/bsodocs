### Master Farmer Outfit

The Master Farmer outfit is craftable with 110 Crafting using Ent hides dropped from Treebeard \(see [Bosses]()\). The outfit gives +3 extra maximum patches, for every type of patch. This stacks with the +2 patches from the Scroll of farming. It does not have to be equipped.

### Master Capes

Master capes are skillcapes that can be purchased upon getting 500M XP in the respective skill. The command to purchase a master cape is `=skillcape hunter master cape` for example. Each one costs 1b gp to purchase and is untradeable. A master cape will provide 8% XP boost if training the corresponding skill, or 3% when training any other skill. This perk is global, and the master cape can be equipped in any gear tab to receive the XP boost. Master capes also have the same stats as an Abyssal Cape without the food reduction perk. 

Additionally, master capes have a perk that is related to the skill that they are corresponding to. Skills with missing perks are either yet to be added or still unknown.
